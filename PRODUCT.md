# Data Product Charter

## Document control

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Data product ID/version | book-competition-data / competition.v1 |
| Product owner | bookchaowalit |
| Data owner/steward | bookchaowalit |
| Producer team | Domain repository |
| Status/review date | Local source pilot / 2026-09-07 |
| Evidence boundary | schema.json, demo.json and tests in this repository |

## Product contract

- Decision or user outcome: Find competitions with relevant deliverables, judging and prize terms.
- Consumers and use cases: Discovery applications; integration planned.
- Source systems and lake layers: Five reviewed official sources → landing → Bronze through the shared local runtime.
- In scope/out of scope: Ranked contests with judging; acceptance-based task rewards belong to bounty.
- Freshness, availability, and volume expectation: Target source review every 24h; open filter rejects checks older than 72h; no live SLA.
- Data classification, residency, retention, and access: Public competition metadata; no user profile; raw source bytes remain in the private local operational archive.
- Quality thresholds and incident route: Contract, live capture, replay and parser tests pass for the enabled sources; owner handles source failures.
- Cost/capacity guardrail: Manual local capture only; six-hour source cooldown and max 10,000 records per envelope.
- Versioning, deprecation, and migration policy: Draft v1; breaking changes version separately; no legacy migration or live consumer yet.
